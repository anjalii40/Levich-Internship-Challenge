description: README Update Workflow
---
After completing any code changes or implementing a new feature:

1.  **Analyze**: Determine if the changes impact the project's features, architecture, configuration, or usage instructions.
2.  **Propose**: If changes are needed, I will explicitly ask:
    > "Should I update the README to reflect [specific changes]?"
3.  **Execute**: Only upon your approval (e.g., "yes", "go ahead"), I will update the `README.md` file.
